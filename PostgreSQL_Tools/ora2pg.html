#PG tools ora2pg utility

How to install and use the ora2pg:

Normally we use ora2pg to migrate the data from Oracle to PostgreSQL. There're two servers which  already installed ora2pg tools on infrm1odb99 and infra1odb99

However from time to time. we may need to use ora2pg on some other environment, such as preprod or cloud. this article aim to easily install the ora2pg and quick use for a task.

More information please check the official doc below:

Requirement
The Oracle Instant Client or a full Oracle installation must be installed on the system, download address:
https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/linuxx86-64soft-092277.html

    rpm -ivh oracle-instantclient12.2-basic-12.2.0.1.0-1.x86_64.rpm
    rpm -ivh oracle-instantclient12.2-devel-12.2.0.1.0-1.x86_64.rpm
    rpm -ivh oracle-instantclient12.2-jdbc-12.2.0.1.0-1.x86_64.rpm
    rpm -ivh oracle-instantclient12.2-sqlplus-12.2.0.1.0-1.x86_64.rpm


Install the rpm package, if some dependence packages are needed, please use yum install them first.
rpm -Uvh oracle-instantclient12.2-basic-12.2.0.1.0-1.x86_64.rpm \
                oracle-instantclient12.2-devel-12.2.0.1.0-1.x86_64.rpm \
                oracle-instantclient12.2-jdbc-12.2.0.1.0-1.x86_64.rpm \
                oracle-instantclient12.2-sqlplus-12.2.0.1.0-1.x86_64.rpm

Installing Ora2Pg
Like any other Perl Module Ora2Pg can be installed with the following commands:

        tar xjf ora2pg-x.x.tar.bz2
        cd ora2pg-x.x/
        perl Makefile.PL
        make && make install


Installing DBD::Oracle
After setting ORACLE_HOME and LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variables as root user, install DBD::Oracle. Proceed as follow:

        export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/oracle/12.2/client64/lib
        export ORACLE_HOME=/usr/lib/oracle/12.2/client64/lib
        perl -MCPAN -e 'install DBD::Oracle'

Install through CPAN manually if the above doesn't work:

        #perl -MCPAN -e shell
        cpan> get DBD::Oracle
        cpan> quit
        cd ~/.cpan/build/DBD-Oracle*
        export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/oracle/11.2/client64/lib
        export ORACLE_HOME=/usr/lib/oracle/11.2/client64/lib
        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make install

If you meet a problem about:  "Oracle.h:37:17: fatal error: oci.h: No such file or directory"， try to use locate command to locate them first
The reason is that Makefile.PL does not write the correct Oracle include path to Makefile

        # locate oci.h
        /usr/include/oracle/11.2/client64/oci.h
        export C_INCLUDE_PATH="/usr/include/oracle/11.2/client64/"

Then compiling again.

Ora2Pg usage
By default Ora2Pg will look for /etc/ora2pg/ora2pg.conf configuration file，also you can give the path where they're located with option -c

        /usr/local/bin/ora2pg -c /etc/ora2pg/ora2pg_new.conf

For more available options, please use ora2pg --help, Main configuration for Oracle migrate to PostgreSQL as following:
